# phenoquant

Quantitative phenotyping for individuals in a hybrid zone. This includes:
* Feature extraction from images
* Dimensionality reduction (to a mimicry-related phenotype)
* Estimating the number of genes underlying the mimicry-related phenotype using admixture proportion estimates (including simulations)

## Methodology
The methods in this package are described in the paper:

J. S. Vestergaard, E. Twomey, R. Larsen, K. Summers and R. Nielsen. Number of genes controlling a quantitative trait in a hybrid zone  of the aposematic frog Ranitomeya imitator, in review with _Proceedings of the Royal Society. Series  B. Biological Sciences_, 2014. 

Therefore, please cite this paper when using the code for publications.
