# phenoquant

Quantitative phenotyping for individuals in a hybrid zone. This includes:
* Feature extraction from images
* Dimensionality reduction (to a mimicry-related phenotype)
* Estimating the number of genes underlying the mimicry-related phenotype using admixture proportion estimates (including simulations)
* Estimating the likelihood whether two quantified phenotypes are controlled by the same or two separate sets of genes.

## Methodology
The methods in this package are described in the papers:

J. S. Vestergaard, E. Twomey, R. Larsen, K. Summers and R. Nielsen. Number of genes controlling a quantitative trait in a hybrid zone  of the aposematic frog Ranitomeya imitator, in review with _Proceedings of the Royal Society. Series  B. Biological Sciences_, 2014. 

J. S. Vestergaard, E. Twomey, A. A. Nielsen, K. Summers and R. Nielsen. Identifying pleiotropic control of adaptive phenotypes, in review with _Genetics_, 2014.
